# In a file called um.py, implement a function called count that expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that “um” appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like hello, um, world, the function should return 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function should return 0.

# Structure um.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.

# import re
# import sys


# def main():
#     print(count(input("Text: ")))


# def count(s):
#     ...


# ...


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# Either before or after you implement count in um.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_um.py, three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of count thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

# pytest test_um.py


import re
import sys


def main():
    print(count(input("Text: ")))


def count(s):
    return len(re.findall(r'\bum\b', s, re.IGNORECASE))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
