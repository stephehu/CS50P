# In Season 5, Episode 23 of NUMB3RS, a supposed IP address appears on screen, 275.3.6.28, which isn’t actually a valid IPv4 (or IPv6) address.

# An IPv4 address is a numeric identifier that a device (or, on TV, hacker) uses to communicate on the internet, akin to a postal address in the real world, typically formatted in dot-decimal notation as #.#.#.#. But each # should be a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. Suffice it to say 275 is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS had validated the address in that scene!

# In a file called numb3rs.py, implement a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

# Structure numb3rs.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.

# import re
# import sys


# def main():
#     print(validate(input("IPv4 Address: ")))


# def validate(ip):
#     ...


# ...


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# Either before or after you implement validate in numb3rs.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_numb3rs.py, two or more functions that collectively test your implementation of validate thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

# pytest test_numb3rs.py


def main():
    print(validate(input("IPv4 Address: ")))


def validate(ip):
    values = ip.split(".")
    if len(values) != 4:
        return False
    for value in values:
        if not value.isdigit():
            return False
        if int(value) > 255:
            return False
        if len(value) > 1 and value[0] == "0":
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
