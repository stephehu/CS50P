# FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

#  _ _ _          _   _     _
# | (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
# | | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
# | | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
# |_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
# Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

# FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

# In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

# Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
# Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
# Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
# Prompts the user for a str of text.
# Outputs that text in the desired font.
# If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

elif len(sys.argv) == 3:
    if sys.argv[1] not in ["-f", "--font"]:
        sys.exit("Invalid Option")
    if sys.argv[2] not in fonts:
        sys.exit("Invalid font")
    figlet.setFont(font=sys.argv[2])
